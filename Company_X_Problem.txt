Company X Problem:


Company X relies upon telemarketing to sell products. 

1. The Sales head of the company has hired you to conduct in-depth exploratory analyses of the historical data. 
The objective of the assignment is to identify sales patterns using all possible combinations of the available fields and implement learnings to drive overall sales (Revenue)


2. Your project lead wants to utilize the opportunity and prepare a business development case.
The lead has asked you to explore different available techniques based on the data insights and prepare a few slides on the technique that can be implemented in the business. 
The lead has also requested you to prepare the objective of the model with a reasonable explanation and also to list additional data requirements to describe the model- including steps and possible impact on the business.


The column headers are self-explanatory, with the 'Sale' column indicating whether a sale was made or not when X called the customer.
